# WebP to PNG Conversion Script

The [main.py](main.py) conversion script and the first draft of this README were generated by the [Iterative Coding GPT](https://chat.openai.com/c/7ad03bf4-8081-411e-bd62-d863321dfb66) in **less than 5 minutes** using the following sequential prompts:

> 1. write a python script that reads a list of '.webp' images from a directory called "originals" and exports to png into a directory called "images". the script will be run on a mac using python 3.11
> 2. next iteration
> 3. next iteration: prompt the user if an image already exists in the 'images' directory with the same name "replace or skip?"
> 4. are there any other features that would be useful?
> 5. next iteration: Batch Processing Option. the default should be to process single file.
> 6. would a test suite be useful for this script?
> 7. next iteration: add a test suite method and test cases to the script. the test suite can be called using a --test command line flag.
> 8. next iteration: write remaining test methods.
> 9. next iteration: add a command line flag for batch mode. if the user does not specify batch mode, the script should process a single file given as the first argument to the script.
> 10. i believe the script is ready for me to test. please generate a README describing  the script and usage examples. I will follow the readme to test the script.
> 11. here is the final script for your review. did I integrate all of the code changes correctly? \<pasted script>

## Overview
This Python script provides a convenient tool for converting images from WebP format to PNG. It supports both single file conversion and batch processing of multiple files within a directory. Additionally, the script includes a test suite that can be run to verify its functionality.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or newer
- Pillow library (`PIL`)
- Argparse (usually included with Python)

Before running the script, ensure you have the Pillow library installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

**Single File Conversion to Current Directory**

```bash
python webp-to-png.py originals/file-name.webp
```

**Single File Conversion to Specified Directory**

```bash
python webp-to-png.py originals/file-name.webp images
```

**Batch Conversion to Current Directory**

```bash
python web-to-png.py --batch
```

**Batch Conversion to Specified Directory**

```bash
python web-to-png.py originals batch_images --batch
```

**Conversion Without Specifying Source**

This will process `.webp` files in the current directory.

```bash
python web-to-png.py --batch
```

**Conversion With Non-existent Source**

```bash
python web-to-png.py non_existent_directory --batch
```

### Running Tests
The script includes a test suite for verifying its functionality. To run the tests, use the `--test` flag:

```bash
python web-to-png.py --test
```

## Script Features
- **Single File and Batch Conversion**: Choose between converting a single WebP file or batch processing an entire directory.
- **Command Line Interface**: Easily specify the source file or directory, target directory, and whether to enable batch mode via command line arguments.
- **Interactive File Conflict Resolution**: When a PNG file with the same name already exists in the target directory, the script prompts the user to replace or skip the file.
- **Test Suite**: Run a suite of tests to ensure the script works as expected across various scenarios.

## Logging
The script logs its operations, including successful conversions, skipped files, and errors, to a file named `conversion_log.log`. This log file is created in the same directory where the script is run.
